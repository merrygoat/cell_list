# Example cell list

This is an example of a cell list in Python. It is intended for the processing of coordinates from exprimental systems
for this reason it does not implement periodic boundary conditions.

The code will only wrok with 3 dimensional datasets at the moment, however, it would be reasonably easy to generalise
this to N dimensional datasets.
